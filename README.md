# Building Your First Neural Network

## Introduction
In this project, you'll get to build a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset! By building a neural network from the ground up, you'll have a much better understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation, and other concepts that are important to know before we move to higher level tools such as Tensorflow. You'll also get to see how to apply these networks solve real prediction problems!

The data comes from the [UCI Machine Learning Database.](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset)
## Instructions
1. `git clone https://github.com/waybarrios/nd101_project1.git`
2. Download Anaconda or miniconda
3. Create a new conda environment:

    ```
    conda create --name dlnd python=3
    Enter your new environment:
    Mac/Linux: >> source activate dlnd
    Windows: >> activate dlnd
    ```
    
    
4. Ensure you have numpy, matplotlib, pandas, and jupyter notebook installed by doing the following:

    `conda install numpy matplotlib pandas jupyter notebook`

5. Run the following to open up the notebook:

    `jupyter notebook dlnd-your-first-neural-network.ipynb`
